# DOM Atomic 03: Show Many Elements

> How did you go about hiding elements initially?

I hid the elements by modifying the HTML document from the previous drill. After changing the classes of some elements to "show_me", I then set their display styles to be none, so they would not be visible when the page initially loaded.
